As we know java doesn't have any packages for Multi Set or Multi Map

==> So I discovered a way to create multi-set and multi-map without importing any external packages
but we can implement it by TreeSet or TreeMap
==> this way is mainly based on making a new comparator as an argument while creating the TreeSet/Map
==> we will make a new comparator and make it work in the usual way except for one thing.
==> if there are any equal elements we will make him return 1 or -1
==> in this case we are deceiving the TreeSet/Map that even if there's an equal elements then we are telling them that they are not equal, so they added it as a different element
