As we know java dosn't have any packages for Multi Set or Multi Map

==> So i descoverd a way to create multi set and multi map without importing any external packages
but we can just implement it by TreeSet or TreeMap
==> this way mainly based on making new comprator as an argument while creating the TreeSet/Map
==> we will make a new comprator and make it work as the normal way except one thing..
==> if there is any equal elements we will make him return 1 or -1
==> in this case we are deceiving the TreeSet/Map that even if there's an equal elements then we are telling them that they are not equal, so they added it as a difference element
